Landing Page Project


Author
Udacity - Provided HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the
Landing Page project.

Anna Winther - Converted the project from a static project to an interactive one by
using Javascript. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but
primarily creating the JavaScript file.
